## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser—no build step is required. For local development with live reload, you can use any static server (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension or `python -m http.server`).

## Structure

```
.
├── assets/
│   └── umbra-logo.svg      # Vector approximation of the Umbra logo
├── index.html              # Landing page markup
├── main.js                 # Interactions, animations, and carousel logic
├── styles.css              # Premium dark theme styling
└── README.md              # Project overview and usage
```

## Customization

- Update palette or typography inside `styles.css` if you need brand tweaks.
- Add new technologies, testimonials, or navigation links by duplicating the relevant elements in `index.html`.
- Enhance loading logic in `main.js` with real form submission handling.
